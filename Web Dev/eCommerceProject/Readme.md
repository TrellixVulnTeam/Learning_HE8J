# Flexbox

flex -direction is primary axis
align items along perpendicular (cross axis)
justify content is main axis

row direction
a - b - c (justify)
a
b
c

        use align items

flex: to get fractions

flex- doesnt work well with padding
can consider using grid -> container has master control over size

# Styled components

How to target components?

```
Styled.div`

&:hover ${anothercomponent's name} {
    whatever styles
}
`
```

# Animation and transition

transition : all 0.5s ease

translate(-100vw)
